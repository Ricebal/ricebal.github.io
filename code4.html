                    This project was a virtual reality simulator for the Dutch police force to train in situations where there might be hostile activity that involves firearms. The point of the project was to take 3d scans of real life locations and load these into a virtual
                    reality world so that officers can explore and familiarize themselve with locations they might not have visited before, without physically going there.

                <p>
                    There was work done to make the simulation as realistic as possible, including modifying the vive controller to feel more like an actual gun. The hard part was loading in the real life map and optimizing it for use within the simulation. Most of the VR
                    backbone was done by Unity but we made sure to develop in a way that didn't, or minimized impact the health of the user, IE motion sickness etc.

                    There is no source code or documentation for this project as all of that is classified information.
                    <br>There is a short video available showcasing an early prototype.
